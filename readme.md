*accounting.js* is a tiny JavaScript library for number money and currency formatting, with optional excel-style column rendering (to line up symbols and decimals). It's lightweight, fully localisable and has zero dependencies.

This branch contains the pages for the github site at **http://josscrowcroft.github.com/accounting.js/**.
